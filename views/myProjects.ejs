                <p>This is an Advanced Smart Registration Web Form application which only accepts specific type of information thanks to <b>RegEx</b> technologies designed for GREEN BELT Gym to be used for Member Registration.</p>
                <p>It was implemented using <b>JavaScript Vanilla</b>. The application validates user input for various fields, such as first name, last name, address, city, postal code, province, age, password, and email. Each input field is associated with an error element that displays appropriate error messages based on the validation results. Event listeners are attached to the input fields to detect changes in their values.</p>
                <p>For each input field, a specific Regular Expression pattern is used to validate the corresponding value. If the input value meets the validation criteria, the error message is hidden, and the background color of the input field is set to white. Otherwise, an error message is displayed, and the background color of the input field is changed to indicate an error.</p>
                <p>There is also a form submission function called <i>ajaxpost()</i>. This function performs a final check on all input fields to ensure that they are valid. If all fields pass validation, the form data is collected using the FormData API and sent to the server via an XMLHttpRequest object. Upon successful submission, an alert message is displayed to indicate the successful creation of a customer record.</p>

              <td>
                <p><b>Improved User Experience:</b><br>The Smart Registration Form enhances the user experience by providing real-time validation feedback. Error messages are displayed immediately when users enter invalid data, allowing them to correct their mistakes promptly. This reduces the chances of form submission errors and provides a smoother registration process.</p>
                <p><b>Data Integrity:</b><br>The client-side form validations implemented through JavaScript help maintain data integrity by ensuring that users enter accurate and valid information. This reduces the likelihood of data inconsistencies or errors in the registration data.</p>
                <p><b>Reduced Server Load:</b><br>By performing form validations on the client side, the Smart Registration Web Form reduces the number of unnecessary server requests. Validations are done before submitting the form, preventing unnecessary server processing for invalid or incomplete data. This improves the efficiency of the registration process and reduces server load.</p>
                <p><b>Error Prevention:</b><br>The form validations implemented in JavaScript help prevent common user errors, such as entering an incorrect email format, providing a weak password, or omitting required fields. By guiding users and highlighting errors in real time, the form encourages accurate data entry, reducing the chances of form submission errors.</p>
                <p><b>Scalability and Maintainability:</b><br>The use of JavaScript for client-side form validations allows for easy scalability and maintainability. Additional validation rules or modifications can be implemented without significant changes to the server-side code. This modular approach simplifies future enhancements and maintenance of the registration form.</p>
